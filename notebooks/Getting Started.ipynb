    "\n",
    "> WebbPSF-Roman provides a customizable interface to perform point-spread function (PSF) simulations and calculations for the Wide-Field Instrument (WFI) planned for Roman. A simulated PSF provides a useful tool for predicting the observatory's performance at a particular combination of wavelength (or bandpass), field position, and pixel scale. PSFs are also an important input to simulate astronomical scenes. For example, WebbPSF-Roman PSFs are used by the Pandeia and STIPS toolkits developed at STScI.\n",

    "The Roman functionality in WebbPSF is summarized on the [STScI Roman software page](https://www.stsci.edu/roman/science-planning-toolbox/psf-simulation) and in the [WebbPSF documentation](https://webbpsf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",

    "\n",
    "> Pandeia is the exposure time calculator (ETC) system that is being developed for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). It's based on a Python engine that calculates three-dimensional data cubes, based on user-specified spatial and spectral properties of one or more sources. The cubes are projected to a detector plane given an instrument configuration and two-dimensional pixel-by-pixel signal and noise properties are extracted. This allows for appropriate handling of realistic point spread functions (as calculated by WebbPSF), MULTIACCUM detector readouts, correlated detector readnoise, dithering, and multiple photometric and spectrscopic extraction strategies. Pandeia includes support for a wide variety of observing modes and has a highly modular, data-driven design that allows for easy extensibility to other instruments and telescopes.\n",
